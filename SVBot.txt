PROJECT INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS (SVBOT) INSTRUCTIONS

1. 
Set up a clean environment
Install conda, then run:

conda create --name svbot_env python=3.10

conda activate svbot_env

2. 
Download the Schnapsen platform (https://github.com/intelligent-systems-course/schnapsen)
Clone the course repo:

git clone <official_schnapsen_repo_url>

cd schnapsen

pip install -e .


3. 
Open VS Code
Create a new folder where you want to put svbot or your own bot + experiments.
Open that folder in VS Code.


4. 
TO USE SVBOT FILES + EXPERIMENTS:
Go to the 'project_is_SVBOT' GitHub repository, open each Python file (SVBot, Experiment 1, 2, and 3),
and simply copy + paste the code into your own .py files in the VS Code folder you created.
(No need to clone repo unless you want to since copying the files works equally as fine.)

Run everything
Make sure your environment is still activated, then run any experiment, for example:
python exp_2.py
